    A variational distribution with uncorrelated, normal distributions.

    Following the mean field approximation, this variational distribution prescribes
    that each weight is independently normal distributed with its own mean and standard
    deviation. This is often the default assumption for BNNs.

    This distribution's variational parameters are `mean` and `log_std`.
