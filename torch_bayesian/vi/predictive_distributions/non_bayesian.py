class NonBayesianPredictiveDistribution(PredictiveDistribution):
    """
    Predictive distribution for non-Bayesian forecasts.

    This predictive distribution converts sampled predictions into point predictions.
    When used with :class:`~torch_bayesian.vi.KullbackLeiblerLoss` or
    :class:`~torch_bayesian.vi.AnalyticalKullbackLeiblerLoss` this distribution
    allows training with a non-Bayesian loss up to the prior term, which can be disabled
    by setting `heat` = 0. It can reproduce MSE (L2) and MAE (L1) loss. To reproduce
    cross-entropy loss, use :class:`~torch_bayesian.vi.CategoricalPredictiveDistribution`
    a set `heat` = 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss_type: str, default: "MSE"
        Sets to loss to imitate. Use "MSE" or "L2" for MSE loss and "MAE" or "L1" for
        MAE loss.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the specified loss type is not supported.

        Parameters
        ----------

            The model output as Tensor of shape (S, \*), where S is the number of
            samples.
