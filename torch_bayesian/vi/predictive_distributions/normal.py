    Predictive distribution assuming uncorrelated, normal distributed forecasts.

    This predictive distribution assumes normal distributed predictions, where all

    When used with :class:`~torch_bayesian.vi.KullbackLeiblerLoss` or
    :class:`~torch_bayesian.vi.AnalyticalKullbackLeiblerLoss` this distribution
    produces a loss related to MSE loss.

    The predictive parameters are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasts.
